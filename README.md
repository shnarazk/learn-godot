## Today I learn

### part 4

There's SortZ in Godot4. It was merged into Node2D.

### part 5

`onready` was renamed to `@onready`

### part 6

We need to read the document on `AnimationStateMachine`. I don't understand how to use or connect to the initial state `Start` well.

### part 9

The transitions among the states need:

- `Switch/Mode`: `Sync`
- `Advance/Mode`: `Disable`

### part 10

- `instance` was renamed to `instantiate`.

### part 11

- The layer setting seems weird... Signal emmiter should be sensible. So grass needs a mask, right?

### part 13

- The movement system for bat were modified completely due to the revised `move_and_slide`.
